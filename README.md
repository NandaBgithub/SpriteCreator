# Sprire creator

- Inspired by the sprite creator from Eloquent Javascript, figured  I'd make my own version of it
with clearer code.

Pretty useful if anytime I need to make spritesheets, but more features can be added, like layering and a new widow to merge an array of sprite sheets vertically and horizontally.
